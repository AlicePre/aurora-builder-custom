			<p>On many worlds, the moon is a revered celestial body with magical properties. On Krynn, the gods of magic are associated with the world's three moons. On the world of Toril, the god Sel√ªne uses the light of the moon to battle darkness. On Eberron, scholars of the Draconic Prophecy decipher ancient secrets from the waxing and waning of that world's twelve moons.</p>
			<p>You, or someone from your lineage, has been exposed to the concentrated magic of the moon (or moons) of your world, imbuing you with lunar magic. Perhaps your ancestor was involved in a druidic ritual involving an eclipse, or maybe a mystical fragment of a moon crashed near you. However you came to have your magic, your connection to the moon is obvious when you cast sorcerer spells. Consult the Manifestations of Lunar Magic table, then choose or randomly determine how your connection to the moon manifests while you cast your sorcerer spells.</p>

			<p><b>Full Moon.</b> Abjuration and conjuration spells.</p>
			<p><b>New Moon.</b> Evocation and necromancy spells.</p>
			<p><b>Crescent Moon.</b> Divination and transmutation spells.</p>

In addition, one creature of your choice in that area regains 3d8 hit points.</p>
			<p><b>New Moon:</b> You momentarily emanate an oppressive gloom. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC or take 3d10 necrotic damage and have its speed reduced to 0 until the end of its next turn. In addition, you become invisible until the end of your next turn, or until you make an attack or cast a spell.</p>
			<p><b>Crescent Moon:</b> You slip through light and darkness.
